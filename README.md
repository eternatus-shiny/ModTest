# Welcome to Beyond the Veil!

A story driven Minecraft Mod inspired by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as other works based on the author.

As of the 6th of April 2020, the mod is released in its beta stage, and is available [on Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beyond-the-veil).

I occasionally post sneak peeks on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzjExgDSkPIOTaRLOK97x1Q).

The mod is 1.12.2 only, and I don't think I'll update to newer MC versions any time soon. It also requires Baubles.

Some of the older code here is shoddily written, due to this being my first foray into Minecraft Modding. World generation and Dweller Dialogue handling are particularly horrid.
